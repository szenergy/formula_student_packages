# FaSTTUBe Formula Student Driverless Path Planning Algorithm
## Path Planning Demo

Welcome to the path planning app. The goal of this app is to visualize the algorithms
that were used in the 2022/23 formula student season by FaSTTUBe (Formula Student Team TU Berlin).

The path planning algorithm is split into three parts:

- Cone Sorting
- Cone Matching
- Path Calculation

There is a special page for visualizing the algorithms that run when the Skidpad mission is selected.

At the top of the page you can select the algorithm you want to explore.
